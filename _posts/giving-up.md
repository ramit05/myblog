" Twenty years from now you will be more disappointed by the things that you didn't do than by the ones you did do.

In this post I am going to share some of the principles and hacks that might bring you success,if not, will surely enchance your life.These principles are:

1. Having Faith

2. Revision is the Key

Many people stumble in life searching for the perfect key to unlock success.I think thorough revision with improvements based on your experiences is an important part of life. It helps you master the work that you have been pursuing for a long time.

4. Being Courageous

The curve of life is not always the same.In fact from my experience, you may never know what is coming next.

5. Embracing Change

Life is tough.New things come along your path which forces you to adapt things that are simpler and more efficient.But as the human nature goes not easy to adapt.The quote from above changed my entire view towards life.It kept me motivated to aspire doing something new everyday.I have been on journeys where people don't travel often. I have set myself a goal which most people don't like to pursue.It helps me in certain ways but the truth is it's hard.

6. Learning is the best investment
