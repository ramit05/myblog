" Twenty years from now you will be more disappointed by the things that you didn't do than by the ones you did do.
So throw off the bowlines.
Sail away from the safe harbor.
Catch the trade winds in your sails.
Explore. Dream. Discover." - Mark Twain



One of the most amazing things in life is life itself.While most people like you and me don't give credit to it as much as we should do.It often is very fragile and short term in nature. The best quotes on life can be derrived from Steve Jobs,

As said by Robert F. Kennedy, “Only those who dare to fail greatly can ever achieve greatly.”.This quote truly anticipates the bandwith of how great people have continously failed and still maintain there aspirations.In life we face new challenges everyday. But what is the tradeoff that people who have a legacy and us have in different ? And more importantly Why ?

In this post I am going to share 2 companies who have embraced the philososphy of failing fast and succeding in almost every aspect that history has ever forseen.These companies are Amazon and Apple.

Amazon as we all know populary started as a book selling online business which today owns a market capitalization of over [$430 billion](https://www.cnbc.com/2017/04/05/amazon-worth-twice-wal-mart.html). It all started with Jeff Bezos who went ahead denying traditional retail methods and enriching a concept of Internet over which he believed the future laid ahead.A Wall Street guy who was a Vice President at D.E. Shaw took an unravelling path to determine and test his luck with technology.

Apple a consumer based company which started in Steve Jobs garage in 1976, took a big hit in the consumer markets and went ahead as the planet's most valuable company.Today Apple is worth over [$750 billion](http://money.cnn.com/2017/03/21/investing/apple-stock-all-time-high-three-quarters-trillion/index.html). The company enjoys a history of epic hype, disaster recovery and controversies. 

In this post I am going to share some of the principles and hacks that might bring you success,if not, will surely enchance your life.These principles are:

1. Staying Focussed 


Many people stumble in life searching for the perfect key to unlock success.I think thorough revision with improvements based on your experiences is an important part of life. It helps you master the work that you have been pursuing for a long time.

2. Art of Persevernece & Regular Revisions

I remeber Dr. APJ Abdul Kalam saying one day,
" If four things are followed - having a great aim, acquiring knowledge, hard work, and perseverance - then anything can be achieved"

3. Embracing Simplicity

For some years during my inital
